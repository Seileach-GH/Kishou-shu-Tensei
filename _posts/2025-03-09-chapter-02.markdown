I gazed at the entire new space and let out a satisfied breath.

The counter was made from a single slab of ancient cedar sourced from the northern forests of the continent. After a careful polishing process, the wood was polished to a rich amber color, its hue as beautiful as amber itself.

The chairs, also made from cedar, had been carefully treated and varnished to reveal a calm, subdued color. The deep red cushions filled with soft padding complemented them perfectly. As expected from the master craftsmen of the Holy King Alliance, where demigods and humans from the western regions intermixed. It was expensive, but there was no regret in the quality of the items they provided.

The lighting in the shop, created with sorcery, was an exquisite piece of work. The color was carefully adjusted to ensure it was easy on the eyes of any race. The antique fixtures used were a masterpiece, taking a full week to craft just one of them.

Even the tea utensils displayed along the walls were chosen with care, with no shortcuts taken. The delicate white and blue porcelain teapots from the Chengki continent were joined by beautiful pieces made from the bones of magical beasts from the Central continent, all of which had an indescribable luster. There were also golden cups and saucers made from divine gold, which I procured with great effort from the Valestin Cathedral.

The gentle wood grain, the light green wallpaper, and the overall harmony of the space made it a sight to behold. Just gazing at it was enough to make my heart swell.

I was proud of my work. The floor was spotless, and the air was faintly fragrant with the blend of black and red tea. The bottles of alcohol reflected the gentle lighting from the walls, sparkling like stars.

Finally, I had arrived here. In the imperial capital's prime location... in an alley, no less, I had become the lord of my own castle after all the hardships I had endured.

But I had succeeded.

The final words of my father, Albrecht, echoed in my mind: "Do not let the blood of humans fade away." With that guiding principle, I had built this high-end, members-only café for the wealthy, turning a vast fortune into a thriving business.

Ah, my ancestors' spirits, behold my proud castle! Despite being built by the humans, a race that has dwindled in numbers due to its rarity and fragility, this is a magnificent stronghold in the Seven Realms, a place where the seven worlds collide.

I will accomplish my goals. I will marry a rare partner of my own kind and continue the legacy of the human race. And one day, I will ensure that our kind is not forgotten and fade into history like ancient creatures that have been long discarded.

It would be tragic if one race were to disappear from this world born from the collision of seven realms. Many races have vanished, and I refuse to accept that humans could be one of them.

Ah, but how strange the twists of fate are.

In my previous life, I lived a peaceful existence in the backstreets of Osaka, inheriting my grandfather's small satin shop. I never imagined that I would be swept into the Great World Disaster and live a second life.

And now, born into the same race, I find myself not as the dominant species, but as a small, weak race that is on the brink of extinction. What a strange fate it is.

In my previous life, I was fortunate enough to inherit a wealthy family’s land and easily transition into a life of leisure. But I never expected such trials in this life.

The common saying is that the hardships in this life are due to the wrongdoings of the past, but I don't recall committing any heinous acts.

Looking back, I always hid my origins. As my father often warned me, "Humans are hunted due to their rarity and are protected in the name of conservation." I relied on magic, or "sorcery," as it is called here, to alter the laws of nature and bring about physical changes, and I lived my life by using these techniques.

I wore a "faceless mask" infused with illusionary magic to avoid detection as a human and infiltrated an academy to earn my degree. As an explorer, I faced many close calls, but I survived and made a fortune by overcoming great dangers. Eventually, I reached a position where I had nothing to be ashamed of, and I started earning a steady income.

Now, this is where my journey begins. I've finally reached the starting point.

I will do it. After living a life of indulgence in my previous life, this time I will connect with my family and bloodline and fulfill the purpose of my existence in this world.

In my past life, I was surrounded by too many humans, so I never truly understood the solitude that comes from living among different species. Being in a position where exposing myself was a weakness was terrifying.

But those days are over. Now, I will start my new life, connect my bloodline, and weave history in the ship of souls. I will take on the responsibilities that humans in the peaceful past had forgotten.

This is my castle. Haven of Rest.

"Now then, please, please take care of things."

Clapping my hands together in prayer, I bowed my head toward the shrine that stood a bit awkwardly inside the shop.

This was my trump card. It was made from fragments of divine power that I had collected in preparation for opening the shop.

When the Seven Realms were formed, the shock of their collision shattered the gods that once existed across the seven worlds. The remnants of these gods were what I had gathered.

I mixed these fragments and, through my own faint faith, wove them together into a kind of "man-made divine power."

The blessings it grants are prosperity in business, favorable connections, and the protection of this shop from the outside world, creating a kind of safe zone.

Well, considering I’m quite the valuable target in the black market myself, having such a divine safeguard is necessary if I’m going to run a business under the guise of being human.

It wasn’t easy to gather these fragments. This Seven Realms world, while seemingly stable, has distortions in dimensions, and it isn’t even a planet, but a "looping single plank" world, causing the space to unravel in many places.

Salvaging forgotten fragments from such a place and pulling them together was a troublesome task.

But this was necessary. Even if I were to find a wife, I couldn’t allow myself to be easily captured like a rare animal in a zoo. I had to create a secure zone, even if it meant doing something a little reckless.

Now, all that’s left is to attract some high-paying customers, gather information about my rare kin, and somehow find a suitable wife.

Money tends to flow where it’s most abundant, and the wealthy are usually those in power who are weak to words like "exclusive" or "special."

So, if I, a rare species, serve them, it’s like adding extra value. With that, I can rake in money and information, and the business will flourish.

At this rate, I should be able to secure a wife before I turn thirty in this life.

Then, I’ll have children and get them adopted by someone of importance, arranging for a position of standing, allowing me to confidently step into the public eye and extend the human race’s lifespan, even if only a little.

This is for the souls of my fellow kin who perished in the Great World Disaster, and for fulfilling the great ambition of my father, who withered away in the end.

"Please, please, let this bring me good fortune."

With a firm prayer directed at the man-made shrine, I stopped indulging in my joy and began preparing for the opening of the shop. The shop was built with the customers in mind, and as such, it was massive, everything about it two or three sizes larger than normal. I walked through it, but then, unexpectedly, the door was knocked.

"Eh...?"

The door was knocked again, and I tilted my head, wondering if it was the sound of the neighbors. But, no, that couldn’t be the case. With the soundproofing enchantment I’d cast to maintain the privacy of the shop, this sort of noise was impossible.

The suppliers wouldn’t come in this way, and the specialty teas and liquors I deal with are usually sourced directly from the wholesalers, so it wasn’t likely for someone to drop by unexpectedly.

Who could it be? I wondered, just as the door was knocked once more.

This was strange. The shop sign hadn’t been put up yet, and the doorplate said "CLOSED." The shopfront may be humble, but it wasn’t the sort of place anyone would mistake for a private residence.

Also, this alleyway was tricky to find, so it wasn’t likely someone would just wander in from seeing the shop.

I had sent out notices to my contacts from my days as an explorer, asking them to help introduce customers, but it was far too soon for anyone to be coming to congratulate me with an opening gift.

Could it be a drunken fool? I thought as I pulled out my central magical device—essentially an arcane computation device, which also served as a pocket watch—and checked the time. It was still early in the evening, so it was unlikely a drunkard would be stumbling in.

The third knock came, and reluctantly, I used my magic to confirm that nothing seemed out of place. With no further hesitation, I decided to respond.

If it was a lost soul, I’d guide them back on track; if it was a fool from early drinking hours, I’d offer them some water and send them on their way.

At the very least, I had the means to handle it, and the shop’s defenses were strong.

"Yes, yes, who’s there?"

"Mm... late..."

When I saw the figure on the other side of the door, I couldn’t help but gape in surprise.

The person standing there was small, especially when compared to the often tall species who stood around 190 cm. She was dressed in a long robe typical of a witch, adorned with various protective charms and catalysts hanging from her attire in a lively display.

Her large-brimmed hat and the long bangs that obscured her face left only her small lips exposed, which were tightly pressed in a rather displeased expression.

"Iraiza...!?"

"Has it been five years? You liar..."

I had prayed for a good connection, but why on earth was a former classmate from the Great Dragon Skull Academy showing up before the opening?

Could it be that the quiet, introverted girl I had once pitied and helped during our school days was now my very first customer...?
