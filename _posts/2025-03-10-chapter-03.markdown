I had been eagerly awaiting the first customer to sit at the counter on the opening day of my shop, but I never imagined that the first would be a former classmate from the Great Dragon Skull Academy, where I had studied magic.

Her name is Elizabeth Abigail Dunbar. Though her full name is Elizabeth, everyone calls her "Eliza" for short—something only I do, so it might not be a name you’re familiar with.

Her hair, the color of gentian flowers, was rich with waves, and it was dyed in various colors like ink, peony, and flower bud yellow, likely due to the magical significance, giving it a lively, chaotic appearance.

Her sleepy, half-lidded eyes, with their soft, downward gaze, held the color of fresh young sprouts, almost like they were on the verge of tears. A tattoo of wings below her left eye, looking like a tear mark, added to her beauty, making it seem like she was always on the verge of crying. Since we parted at graduation, nothing about her had changed.

While her appearance was similar to a human’s, with just a 20 cm height difference between us, Eliza is not actually human.

She belongs to a race known as Witchlings, a rare species that can manipulate magic naturally. They are a female-only race, and although she is a born prodigy with magic, she is practically "immortal," able to regenerate from locations tied to her physical composition. For a species that has suffered greatly from death and capture, it's no wonder their existence feels rather unjust.

"Looks like you really were a liar, huh... Joshua... I can’t believe you had such a face..."

Her hand reached toward me, but just before it touched my skin, it was repelled by an invisible barrier. Eliza’s eyes widened in surprise, likely at the strength of the magical barrier I had placed to neutralize her constant magical defenses.

I gently grasped her hand that had been extended toward me—noting that it was okay for me to touch first—and held it, just as I had once guided her through the halls of our school when she was hesitant to attend class.

"...Well, as you can see, I’m human. So, I’ve had to take some precautions."

"Did you really need to do this... even with me...?"

"Being human and wandering around, you never know what could happen, right?"

"Even with such a strong barrier...?"

Her voice sounded melancholic as she furrowed her brow. I had no choice but to apologize to her. It had always been too risky to take off my "Faceless Mask" in the safe confines of our school, and even now, remaining unprotected was dangerous.

As a rule, the man-made divine barrier I created had been set to repel anyone other than myself unless I granted them permission. It wasn’t easy to change this setting.

But then again, these are the rules for a place like this. No touching allowed.

"Sorry, it's just how the magic works. But Eliza, you’ve changed, huh? You went through the trouble of reading the future just so you could be the first to offer your congratulations."

"I knew the letter announcing the opening would arrive... today," she said.

"Then why couldn’t you wait until opening day?"

"I... didn’t want there to be too many people."

Her voice was so faint, it almost seemed like it might disappear into the air. But it was probably because her specialty was "time vision."

She could sift through countless elements that form the world, calculating and deducing to determine which ones connected to the future. By using this ability, she could predict the most likely future outcomes.

She, like me, had specialized in "time" magic. She must have foreseen either my future or her own, and perhaps even the opening of my shop.

It was an incredibly delicate process, like pulling at a fragile thread that could snap at any moment. But if she really put her mind to it, I’m sure she could make it happen.

She had always called me a "liar" back in our school days, when I was pretending to be a half-god from the Western regions, and she probably read into some small details and predicted that I would eventually open this "Haven of Rest."

Even so, I didn’t expect her to use such a significant ability just to be the first to present me with an extravagant bouquet of rare flowers.

"I just... wanted to be your first, you know... liar... my only friend from school..."

"You say the nicest things, Eliza. Well, you’ve become quite the bureaucrat. Should I start calling you Sir Dunbars?"

"Stop it..."

Pouting slightly, Eliza had graduated with honors from the Dragon Skull Academy, but unlike me, who ended up in a shady job, she had become a top-level technical bureaucrat in the Federation Empire. She had passed an exam with a success rate of less than 1%, and only the top five received the prestigious title of "Knight Baron."

She was the real genius, unlike me, who ended up in less reputable work. Still, I couldn’t help but remember how she had once been shy and flustered when we were asked to work in pairs for class projects.

"I wonder where you've been assigned? You’ve always been so bad at replying to letters," I said with a slight whistle, though it was a bit unrefined.

"Ah, I’m in the Advanced Tactical Magic Division... but... I was too busy and... too embarrassed to reply," Eliza responded with a bit of hesitation. "And you’ve been traveling all over... I haven’t been able to receive any letters from you either..."

Ah, she was in the Advanced Tactical Magic Division—formally known as the National Defense Advanced High-Level Magic Planning Bureau. It’s a subsidiary organization of the Internal National Defense Bureau, responsible for researching magic related to tactical and strategic defense. They don't just develop existing magic; they create entirely new methods, working with geniuses from other dimensions. Only those with extraordinary talent are sent there.

To think my friend has been working there for five years... It’s quite an achievement. Back when we were students, she almost cried at the thought of having to pair up with someone for an assignment. Now, look at her.

"I should explain the system, but since you’re my very first customer, let’s make this my treat for today," I said with a smile.

"No, that’s too much... I came to congratulate you," Eliza responded, almost in protest.

"You brought such a wonderful gift. I can’t let you pay for the seat. It wouldn’t be fair," I said, gently cradling the bouquet of flowers she had brought for the opening.

Truly, she had brought an amazing gift.

The bouquet, with chrysanthemums as the centerpiece, must have been cultivated on powerful ley lines, as their hidden energy was extraordinary. The way the flowers were picked had magical significance, as I could easily tell.

"To think you’d gather chrysanthemums before the morning dew falls at this time of year—this is not something just anyone can do. The hidden power in them is remarkable, and the purifying aura they give off is incredible. They must’ve cost quite a bit, right?"

"I... I did my best..." Eliza said, bashfully.

"Ah, I’m so happy to receive such rare material. I’ll have to think about what to do with it. I could turn it into a charm or even soak it in alcohol to create a spirit."

I eagerly embraced the flowers and summoned a box from the store’s back room using magic. The store was filled with the protection of artificial divine spirits and my own magic circles, which gave me a degree of power that allowed me to control almost everything within this space.

Of course, if I were to leave, I would be just another average mage. I had to be careful not to get too cocky, or things would go badly for me.

"I’m so glad you brought such a wonderful gift... It was worth the effort," I said, my happiness clear.

"A visit from an old friend to celebrate the opening—how could I not be happy?" I added.

When I placed the flowers in a visible spot, I guided Eliza to a seat. She hesitated a little as she sat down.

"Is something wrong?"

"Well... it’s just that I’m heavier than you..." Eliza replied, unsure.

"Don’t worry, lady, that’s not a concern," I reassured her with a smile.

I helped her settle into the chair. Since she was about 20 cm taller than me, the chair glided smoothly into place as her weight settled.

"Wow... amazing... Is this a magical chair?" she asked, clearly impressed.

"Yes, it’s a custom piece from the West. It’s the kind of thing that wouldn’t be out of place in the imperial banquet hall," I explained.

This wasn’t just a regular chair. It was a piece of magical furniture designed to support any weight without affecting its movement. It could be pushed or pulled easily and made no noise. Even if you leaned back, it wouldn’t tip over. It was incredibly convenient.

I’d had to struggle quite a bit to get it made. The craftsman I knew insisted on one payment per piece, which made me hesitate at first, but now that I was able to welcome a customer, it felt worth every coin.

"You really went all out..." Eliza remarked.

"I did it for this very purpose," I replied.

Several thousand years had passed since the Seven Worlds were created, and in this world, where the laws of the seven realms are blended into a Möbius strip, there are countless mysteries. There are stars and moons in the sky, even though the world is not a sphere, and three satellites shine, exchanging energy with each other. There are still unexplored lands and unknown knowledge.

Adventurer-like professions, which you’d expect to see in a fantasy RPG, exist in this world to explore these mysteries.

"I knew you wouldn’t go down the same path as me, but I didn’t see this kind of deception coming from you..." Eliza said with a sigh.

Well, I was a bit of a rogue myself. The work I did was shady enough that no one would question my disguise, which is probably why I was able to start this shop. Despite the danger and several near-death experiences, I was able to form the connections I needed, so I didn’t regret it.

"By the way, Eliza, are you still as much of a lightweight as before?"

"I... I can drink a little now... just like before," she replied with a small blush.

"Well then, let’s see how much you’ve grown," I said with a playful smile, picking up a glass of amber-colored distilled liquor.

Hehe, there’s a technique where you can weaken the alcohol’s effect with magic to make it easier to drink.

Coincidentally, there’s a cocktail with the same name as my friend, so I thought I’d serve it to her in the same way.

I grabbed a mixing glass and a stirrer to prepare the drink for my unexpected first guest...
