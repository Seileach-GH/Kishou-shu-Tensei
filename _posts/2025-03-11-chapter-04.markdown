Eliza has very little memory of her childhood.

This is because the Witchling species is almost "naturally occurring," and family units are formed when a group stumbles upon others of their kind and creates a family by chance.

Because of this, Eliza can be considered quite unlucky from the moment she was born.

She was born at the peak of a sacred mountain, by a small lake where the wind blew strongly, and it took a long time for the other Witchlings to find her. For almost eighty years, she was left alone, playing with the wind and flowers, gazing at the ever-changing mountains. Because of this, she lacked the opportunity for proper mental development and became extremely poor in interpersonal skills by the time she was welcomed into the Dunbar group.

When she was finally found by her mentor, Amarie, and given the baptismal name "Abigail," becoming the twelfth member of their eleven-member Witchling family, she remained much the same.

It would take several minutes for her to even speak a simple yes or no, and while Amarie accepted this patiently, the other parents judged that Eliza would have a hard time living this way.

After a long family meeting, it was decided that she would be sent to a school—something that was unusual for Witchlings, as they are typically born with powerful magical talents that stem from their place of origin. With proper control, they don't need formal schooling. Usually, Witchlings only learn through informal lessons from their parents, traveling with them and adapting to their way of life.

So, at first, Eliza cried fiercely, refusing to be thrown into a place full of strange people. She had heard that the school she was being sent to, the Grand Dragon Skull Academy, was built inside the skull of a massive dragon, and that it would be filled with children—something she could never bear.

But despite her resistance, the more strict parents, especially Amarie, insisted that she would face severe struggles later in life if she wasn't pushed out of her comfort zone. Amarie was the only one to feel sorry for Eliza, but her sympathy was dismissed. The decision was made to send her to this school on the Central Continent, in a region temporarily defined as the "surface" of their world—a place of great uncertainty.

The Dragon Skull Academy was vast and prestigious, one of the top five schools in the Federal Empire, a society deeply rooted in technocratic bureaucracy.

The academy offered a wide range of courses and its faculty exceeded five hundred, with a student body numbering in the thousands. It was a place of intense competition, where success wasn't guaranteed just by being accepted; progress was determined by one’s accomplishments, connections, and technical achievements, not just grades.

For Eliza, who was struggling with the enormity of this system, life there was especially difficult. The courses were numerous, and simply sitting in lectures wouldn't be enough. The professors constantly asked difficult questions, pushing her to her limits. With so many classes and instructors to choose from, she felt completely overwhelmed.

She had a hard time just filling out her curriculum application on the final day of the deadline.

"Is there something troubling you?"

It was Joshua, a second-year student, who noticed her predicament. Having already settled in at the academy, he saw the unfamiliar look on Eliza’s face and realized she was struggling.

Joshua, with his silver-trimmed white mask and small stature, might have looked suspicious to some, but his gentle demeanor made Eliza instinctively feel safe. After several minutes, perhaps even close to an hour of hesitation, she finally sought his help.

Joshua, noticing her difficulty in speaking, immediately adapted and patiently helped her. He didn't mind waiting for her to gather her words, observing her efforts to speak and the way her gaze shifted nervously. With kindness, he understood that speaking wasn’t easy for her and gave her space to try.

"Then it’s simple. I’ll accompany you. I’m not the type to leave a struggling underclassman behind and sleep soundly."

For an entire hour, Joshua agonized, but finally mustered the courage to speak to Eliza with sincere kindness. He patiently taught her how to fill out the curriculum application, helping her plan a schedule that balanced meaningful courses with relaxing ones. He worked with her right until the student office was about to close.

Thus began Eliza's student life with Joshua.

Whenever she left the dorm, she would waddle around looking for the silver-trimmed mask and, upon finding him moving around, would stick close to him like a bird imprinted with its caretaker, constantly seeking his guidance on how to attend classes and navigate this new world.

Given her inherent talent with magic—being from a species with natural aptitude for it—she quickly flourished. Although she struggled with speaking, her practical skills were flawless, which allowed her to advance to higher-level courses in no time. Her speed of progression even surpassed Joshua, who was skipping grades, and she reached the same seminar as him, albeit for different reasons. The real driving force behind her rapid advancement was simply her desire to stay close to him.

Afterward, Eliza enjoyed several happy years. Since they were under the same professor, they met daily in the research lab—although Joshua never once removed his mask—and spent many days working together. Those times were among the happiest of her life.

But, as cruelly as time can be, it eventually pulled them apart.

The unique nature of the Witchling species and the rapid success of Eliza's research led to her completing her doctoral program earlier than expected. By then, Joshua was still working on his doctoral thesis, so he had a long way to go before graduation. As he told her, he needed a lot of time to confront himself, and Eliza, upon hearing this, cried for hours, unwilling to accept the graduation that loomed ahead. It took a night of earnest persuasion for her to finally graduate, convinced that cutting corners would only lower her value.

However, what surprised her was not her own graduation, but rather Joshua's unexpected decision to abandon the promising career in the bureaucracy he could have had and instead take up the dangerous life of an adventurer.

He had always worn his mask due to the ugly scar on his face, belonging to a half-god, half-human race, but Eliza had sensed that he wasn't entirely of that species. What truly hurt was that she never imagined he would lie about the promise he made to her during their student days: "I won't leave you alone, crybaby." The betrayal stung deeply, and with tears, Eliza drank from her cup in bitter resignation, thinking, He’s a liar after all.

Although she knew he wasn’t a half-god from his demeanor, she never expected that his words would prove false. Feeling betrayed, she sulked and took a long time to respond to his letters. Yet, she was taken by surprise when she had a vision about him—a future where he would return to open a shop.

Once she saw the future where he was coming back, she immediately sprang into action. She prepared a celebratory gift, something she knew would bring him joy, and resolved to visit him at the right time—early, but without making a nuisance of herself.

On the day she fulfilled this plan, she was shocked by what she discovered.

She could not have anticipated that the gentle, younger senior she had once known, the one who had graduated after her, would turn out to be human.

Although he had always been small and had an undeniable cuteness that made one want to take care of him, she never imagined he belonged to the most adorable species in the world—one that was even feared to be on the brink of extinction. Eliza’s visions had never foreseen this truth until he revealed his face for the first time.

What’s more, he had opened a café where humans could come and interact with him.

Had it been possible, or perhaps more accurately, if it were allowed, Eliza might have immediately snatched him away. However, thanks to the artificial divine protection he had acquired from somewhere, her magic wouldn't work on him, and there was no way to touch him unless he permitted it. Reluctantly, she realized she had no choice but to accept this fact.

Determined, Eliza vowed to fulfill her long-held ambition from their student days: to cement her place as his betrothed childhood friend, rewriting the past if necessary to ensure that she became firmly entrenched in his future.
