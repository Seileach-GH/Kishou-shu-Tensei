“Could such an adorable creature truly exist...?”

A woman murmured in awe. Her hands trembled as she resisted the urge to reach out, and her mouth watered uncontrollably. Would she have believed it just hours ago—that such fortune would befall her today?

Once, the worlds across seven parallel universes were each distinct and separate. However, thousands of years ago, during the great calamity now known only in history as the "Grand World Disaster," they merged into one. Though the cataclysm wrought chaos, the intelligent beings of the seven worlds adapted and persevered, forging ahead despite the drastic changes to their existence.

At the heart of this unified world lay a vast continent, safeguarded by a powerful nation. This constitutional monarchy, known as the Federated Empire, maintained a delicate balance between centralization and regional governance. Its capital’s imperial citadel housed a meticulously structured administrative system, where numerous aristocratic and technocratic officials devoted their days to public service.

Among them was a singular being—one of the so-called "vampires." She was an exceptionally long-lived and extraordinarily powerful female, standing out even among her kin. Holding a stack of documents in one hand, she strode down the corridor and entered a room labeled "Foreign Affairs Division 1."

This department functioned as the liaison between the Empire's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs for diplomatic matters. Nestled within the citadel’s inner sanctum, it was among the five most critical offices of the state.

The vampire was its director. She had just returned from a meeting—one that, without her profound linguistic knowledge, keen historical insight, and commitment to mutual understanding, would have surely ended in failure. Yet, despite resolving such a challenging issue, she walked with an air of nonchalance, as if it were a mere triviality.

Her beauty was both mesmerizing and terrifying.

She stood at least 2.5 meters tall, her body draped in wings that resembled a cloak of velvet. A black evening dress, embroidered with gold and silver thread, accentuated her curvaceous form—a pinnacle of feminine allure. Her features were not merely well-proportioned; they were so flawlessly arranged that they became overwhelming, exuding an aura of "beautiful yet fearsome."

Her face, noble and elongated, bore an elegantly tapered chin—so delicate one might worry whether she could even bite. Her skin was a milky white, just shy of pale, further emphasized by her long, narrow eyes of deep pigeon-blood red.

Her full lips sat beneath a finely sculpted nose, the bridge of which seemed chiseled by a sculptor obsessed with perfection. The depth of her facial structure struck a perfect balance between severity and gentleness. Her androgynous beauty, combined with her sensual physique, created a jarring contrast that unsettled all who gazed upon her.

Even among other species—even among her own kind, considered a superior race—her beauty inspired awe and fear.

With a regal grace, she sank into the seat marked with her title and crossed her long, white-trousered legs. Having settled all critical matters before noon, including negotiations that could potentially shape the fate of the Empire, only minor tasks remained.

Replying to invitations for evening soirées, scheduling social tea gatherings, attending interspecies harmony symposiums—tedious social obligations. Sending congratulatory telegrams and floral arrangements for various events, fulfilling ceremonial duties.

In short, nothing of interest to her.

Half-distracted, she set reminders on her newly acquired multipurpose daily assistant—a so-called AR device imported from the eastern continent—while penning letters. That was when she noticed, at the edge of her vision, one of her subordinates looking visibly distressed.

"Yes, yes, that matter, of course… The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well… Yes, yes, I will handle it… Oh, um, that is…"

The panicked voice, the uneasy demeanor—someone had clearly made a blunder.

With a sigh, the vampire turned her sharp gaze toward her subordinate. Or rather, she merely looked at them with mild concern, but her naturally piercing eyes made it seem like a glare.

"U-um, Director…"

"I heard most of it. Some fool at Foreign Affairs made a mess, didn’t they?"

"Yes… and now the Northern Alliance diplomats are absolutely furious…"

Her subordinate, a pale-skinned undead species, looked utterly drained. Their usual ghostly blue aura flickered weakly—a sign of their mounting exhaustion as they braced for the grueling diplomatic damage control ahead.

"So, Director, I hate to ask on such short notice, but I may need to travel for formal apologies…"

"Fine. If they refuse to budge, call me in."

"Understood…"

She reassured her subordinate, knowing she would have to clean up after them regardless. Yet, noticing the lingering dejection on their face, she decided to ask.

After some hesitation, her subordinate confessed that they had made a long-awaited reservation at a renowned establishment—one they had been trying to book for an entire month.

"It's called ‘Haven of Rest’…"

The shop card was simple—just the name in elegant cursive on a plain white background. No further information.

"What kind of place is this? If you're pressed for time, I assume it's a restaurant?"

"It's a tearoom. A members-only one."

The director raised an eyebrow. A café? Hardly the kind of place one would anticipate for a month. Typically, cafés served as places to rest, exchange information, or—once upon a time—conduct stock trades. At most, patrons would linger for a quarter of an hour. If it were about the tea and sweets, they could simply visit before their diplomatic trip.

"You say that, but… once you're inside, you never want to leave."

"A café where people don’t want to leave? That’s rare."

"Ugh… But I wouldn’t want to cause trouble for the shop… Though, if it’s you, Director, I suppose it’s fine…"

With that, the vampire cast a soundproofing spell and listened as her subordinate whispered.

Apparently, the café offered an unparalleled experience—one so blissful it was practically otherworldly.

"Blissful?"

"The very embodiment of happiness."

The vampire momentarily wondered if it was some kind of indecent establishment, but her subordinate was not the type for such amusements.

And so, with an open evening ahead of her, the vampire decided—for once—to indulge her curiosity.

Haven of Rest.

Riding a personal carriage drawn by a headless horse, she arrived at an exclusive district of the imperial capital, home to luxury boutiques that only accepted clientele by appointment.

A small alley. A discreet entrance, devoid of any ostentatious signage.

"A high-level ward… A barrier to repel the uninvited. And this key…"

It bore a striking resemblance to noble social clubs—places where only the elite were allowed entry.

The vampire stepped inside.

A calm, expansive space greeted her. A counter sat at the front, while a long hallway hinted at private rooms further in.

She inhaled slightly. The scents of various teas mingled, yet each aroma remained distinct—perfectly maintained and harmoniously balanced.

A chime rang. Light footsteps approached.

"A first-time visitor, I see."

"Yes. I was referred here."

The server was an Andronian—one of the mechanical lifeforms from the eastern continent. Towering at nearly 3 meters, clad in a mechanical maid uniform, she was unmistakable.

"Master."

"Right away."

At the Andronian’s call, the shopkeeper emerged.

The vampire—an unparalleled beauty—was struck as though by lightning.

A slender figure, barely 170 cm tall. Simple, well-fitted attire. Long black hair, loosely tied. Soft brown eyes, slightly drooping, the right one adorned with a monocle.

A human.

A species now critically endangered, with fewer than ten thousand remaining in the Sevenfold World.

Before she could even process her astonishment, the words slipped from her lips.

"So… cute…"

Compared to a standard human, the figure was exceedingly small. Slender limbs, delicate fingers, and petite facial features—so adorably fragile that it was no surprise they had once been overhunted for "pet-like purposes," leading to their dwindling numbers. Even for a noble vampire, it was a rare sight.

"You come recommended by Lady Wilwiela. Please, allow me to show you to your seat."

The vampire, whose head barely reached the chest of the adorable creature speaking, found herself led to a seat. Normally, she would never walk so unsteadily, yet she followed as if entranced. When her guide pulled out a massive chair, made for a "standard" human of around two to three meters tall, she instinctively reached out to stop them.

Such small, adorable hands shouldn’t be hurt by such an act.

"Please, have a seat."

"O-Oh, yes..."

Yet she couldn't bring herself to stop them, because she didn’t want to miss a single movement of this tiny being. As she was urged to sit, she carefully lowered herself, ensuring that she barely placed any weight on the chair, mindful of her guide’s effort.

Once she was seated, and the angle and depth were adjusted to perfection, the shopkeeper moved behind a counter far too tall for his stature. Using an invisible platform created by sorcery, he stepped up with a small, determined movement that seemed to say "Alright, up we go!"

"Once again, it is a pleasure to meet you. I am Joshua, son of Albrecht, and the proprietor of this establishment, Haven of Rest. This is my attendant, Gulzephon 1021. Please feel free to address us however you prefer."

When asked how she should be addressed, the vampire instinctively gave her real name—something she wouldn’t normally do in an unfamiliar establishment.

"Zealilyuse Oppenheim-California-Washingtonia."

"Lady Washingtonia, then."

Hearing her surname used so formally, her chest tightened.

To be treated so distantly by such a cute creature... it was almost enough to make her cry.

"No, just call me Zealilyuse. This is my private time, after all."

"Then, I am honored to call you by your first name."

With a smile, Joshua continued, explaining the system of the establishment. At some point, his gloved hand had already procured a menu.

"Our establishment operates on a reservation and time-based system. For every half-hour, the charge is fifty denarions, which includes one tea and one confectionery. Additional orders are priced as listed on the menu."

A commoner would have been shocked at the price. A single denarion was a silver coin, enough for an ordinary person to live comfortably for a day. Even in the imperial capital, where an educated worker’s starting salary ranged from sixty to eighty denarions, it was exorbitant.

But for nobles, it was a trivial sum.

And if it allowed them to converse with the Hito-shu—the human species—it was practically a bargain.

"There are no service fees or taxes. Any questions?"

"…No. If anything, I'm surprised at how reasonable this is."

"We pride ourselves on clear pricing. Now then, I will begin your session."

Joshua pulled a pocket watch from his vest, checked the time, and pressed the crown. Some kind of spell was activated, but the vampire—who would normally analyze such things—was too preoccupied to care.

Every movement he made was small, elegant yet slightly clumsy, utterly endearing.

She hadn’t been this captivated by a living being since she had seen a newborn kitten in her family estate.

"Zealilyuse-sama, what would you like to drink? Today’s confectionery is apple compote."

"…I’ll have crimson tea."

"Understood."

With perfect etiquette, Joshua lifted an array of utensils into the air with sorcery, carefully arranging them as he began brewing the tea.

"We have a variety of tea leaves if you wish to browse. If I may suggest, today we have a fine selection from Maurya that pairs exceptionally well with the dessert."

"Then, I'll have that."

Following his recommendation, she ordered it. His delicate hands moved with flawless precision, steeping the crimson tea. The hot water, enchanted with a heat-retention spell, maintained the perfect temperature. Even before the tea had fully brewed, an enchanting aroma filled the air.

Once the leaves had opened completely, the tea was poured into a pre-warmed cup. Its color and fragrance were nothing short of mesmerizing.

And the fact that such small, delicate hands had personally prepared it only enhanced her appreciation.

To her, a tea she had tasted countless times now seemed like a divine nectar.

"Oh, and Zealilyuse-sama… As you are a vampire, if it would not displease you, I would like to offer you a special service."

"…What might that be?"

Joshua smiled, then removed his left glove. He conjured a small, needle-like spell and pressed it against his fingertip, drawing a tiny bead of blood.

Zealilyuse nearly gasped.

Such an innocent creature, harming itself—it was unbearable to watch.

Yet, as his hand moved over her teacup and the droplet of blood prepared to fall, her cry caught in her throat.

"Would you care to try it?"

"P-Please…"

She had meant to speak with grace, yet her words came out in short, breathy syllables.

Time seemed to freeze as the blood droplet fell.

Not only was he utterly adorable, but his service was impeccable.

With trembling hands, she lifted the tea—ensuring she did not let the saucer clink against the cup, as befit a noble’s dignity—and brought it to her lips.

The taste was beyond compare.

The tea’s natural flavors remained intact, but now, a richness infused with "life and vitality" caressed her tongue.

At that moment, she resolved to reward the subordinate who had introduced her to this place.

Perhaps she would treat them to an extravagant meal at the finest establishment she could find.

Or even handle all of their pending tasks for them.

No—she would absolutely become a regular here.

She might even come again tomorrow.

With that thought in mind, the noble vampire slowly savored each sip, reveling in the experience.
