        <p>Thousands of years ago, a great catastrophe occurred when worlds that were never meant to merge collided. The newly fused land was so harsh that only higher-order species could survive, forcing them to restart civilization with unique cultural forms. Now, having entered a period of stability, one species teeters on the brink of extinction.</p>
        <p>Humans. Once the dominant species of their world before the disaster, they lost both the new environment and the wars that followed the world's unification. Swallowed by other nations, their fragile bodies, short lifespans, and extreme disparity between gifted and ordinary individuals led to a slow decline. Their population has now fallen below a hundred thousand, rendering them little more than a minority race.</p>
        <p>Yet, despite their small and fragile nature, humans became prized among the other species of the fused world for their "adorable" appearance. This gave rise to a different kind of demand—they came to be cherished as comforting, almost pet-like companions.</p>
        <p>Reborn into such a world, one man receives a dying wish from his grandfather: to ensure that the human bloodline does not perish. Using his meager inheritance to purchase citizenship, he sets out on a single, daunting path—creating a peaceful harem to contribute, however slightly, to reversing the population decline. To that end, he opens a high-end café, choosing to build connections with many different species.</p>
        <p>Thus begins a conspiracy-laced romantic comedy filled with non-human heroines.</p>
